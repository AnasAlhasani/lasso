import UIKit

/// An ephemeral object which places a controller into the view controller hierarchy. Upon placement, the caller is given
/// the resulting context - the environment into which the controller has been placed.
///
/// The ScreenPlacer client needs:
///   - to be able to place a view controller into the view controller hierarchy
///   - to be able to effect changes in the view controller hierarchy following initial controller placement
///
/// The ScreenPlacer client does not care about:
///   - artifacts of the view controller hierarchy preceding the immediate, placed context
///
/// Thus, the ScreenPlacer 'erases' the previous context. This allows us to implement controller sequences that are
/// modular with respect to the view controller hierarchy.
///
/// ScreenPlacers retain strong references to their dependent controllers. Retaining a ScreenPlacer will retain those dependent controllers.
///
/// Any ScreenPlacer instance will only place once. Any further call to 'place' will simply return the PlacedContext without creating any side
/// effects in the existing view controller hierarchy.
