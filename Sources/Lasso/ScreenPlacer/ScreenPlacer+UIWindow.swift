/// Place some controller as the root of the window with an optional animation. The next context
/// is the controller which is placed.
///
/// An exhaustive variety of built-in transition animations are available here. Some transitions reflect typical
/// UIKit transitions (e.g. pushing onto a navigation controller). Use of these transitions can drastically decrease
/// the complexity of view controller hierarchies while maintaining familiar transition animations. This is achieved by
/// setting some 'next' controller as the root of the window with the desired transition, as opposed to placing that
/// 'next' controller on top of some existing view controller hierarchy.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - window: the window to be placed into
///   - transition: the transition to be animated
/// - Returns: the placer

/// Do _not_ use `rootOfApplicationWindow` in the context of an iOS Extension, since
