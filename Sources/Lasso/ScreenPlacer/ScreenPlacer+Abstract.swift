// Embodiment of the supported ScreenPlacer structures. Clients can call these utilities to make custom ScreenPlacers.
// B/c the init on ScreenPlacer is not publicly exposed, these utilities represent the only paths
// through which clients can create custom ScreenPlacers.
// MARK: - Instance Placement

/// Place some UIViewController relative to some Base artifact.
///
/// Choosing the appropriate NextContext is up to the discretion of the implementer. Intuitively, the NextContext
/// should reflect some artifact which allows placement of some 'next controller' in a position 'immediately tangent'
/// to the originally placed controller. By following this rule, one can place a sequence of screens in a reasonable way.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - base: any object into which the controller can be placed
///   - place: a closure which executes the placement of the controller relative to the base
/// - Returns: the logical 'next' screen context

// MARK: - Embedding
//
// ScreenPlacers are composable with respect to embeddings - any placer instance can be embedded. To embed is simply to
// to say "you're actually going place this container controller, and I'm going to place controller(s) in that container".
// All embeddings are deferred - the container is not placed until all requisite children of that container are placed.
// Embedding placers are required (by definition) to return the container as the PlacedContext. This is intuitively
// pleasing - the next logical target for placement following placement into a container is some other placement into that container.
// In this way, the container is a sort of persistent context with respect to embedding placers.

/// Make a ScreenPlacer which places a child controller into a container.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - embedder: the container
///   - place: a closure which executes the placement of the child into the container
///   - onDidPlaceEmbedded: a closure to be executed immediately following placement of the child into the container
/// - Returns: a ScreenPlacer which places the child into the container
